# given an array of integers, where each integer represents the number of
# coins_sub_i, return an array of integers, where each integer represents the
# number of complete steps you can make with that coins_sub_i number of coins.
# steps look like this:

# steps   | step number | coins recuired to go to complete upt to this point
# o               1                               1
# oo              2                               3
# ooo             3                               6
# oooo            4                               10
# ooooo           5                               15

# sample input: [2, 3, 8, 3]

# sample output: [1, 2, 3, 2]
